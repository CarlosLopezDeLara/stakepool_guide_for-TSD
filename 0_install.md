# Installing and Running a Node


## PREREQUISITES

Set up your platform:

You will need:

* An x86 host (AMD or Intel), Virtual Machine or AWS instance with at least 2 cores, 4GB of RAM and at least 10GB of free disk space;
* A recent version of Linux, not Windows or MacOS â€“ this will help us isolate any issues that arise;
* Make sure you are on a network that is not firewalled. In particular, we will be using TCP/IP port 3000 and 3001 by default to establish connections with other nodes, so this will need to be open.
* You can follow this [SERVER TUTORIAL](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-tutorials/blob/master/node-setup/AWS.md) to get the server up and running. Alternatively, and only for learning purposes you can try this guide on VirtualBox [UBUNTU IMAGE FOR VIRTUAL BOX](https://linuxhint.com/install_ubuntu_virtualbox_2004/)

## Install dependencies

We need the following packages and tools on our Linux system to download the source code and build it:
    - the version control system ``git``,
    - the ``gcc`` C-compiler,
    - C++ support for ``gcc``,
    - developer libraries for the the arbitrary precision library ``gmp``,
    - developer libraries for the compression library ``zlib``,
    - developer libraries for ``systemd``,
    - developer libraries for ``ncurses``,
    - ``ncurses`` compatibility libraries,
    - the Haskell build tool ``cabal``,
    - the GHC Haskell compiler.

If we are using an AWS instance running Amazon Linux AMI 2 (see the [AWS walk-through](AWS.md) for how to get such an instance up and running)or another CentOS/RHEL based system, we can install these dependencies as follows:

    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum install git gcc gcc-c++ tmux gmp-devel make tar wget zlib-devel -y
    sudo yum install systemd-devel ncurses-devel ncurses-compat-libs -y

For Debian/Ubuntu use the following instead:


    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo apt-get -y install build-essential pkg-config libffi-dev libgmp-dev libssl-dev libtinfo-dev libsystemd-dev zlib1g-dev make g++ tmux git jq wget libncursesw5 -y

If you are using a different flavor of Linux, you will need to use the package manager suitable for your platform instead of `yum` or `apt-get`, and the names of the packages you need to install might differ.

Download, unpack, install and update Cabal:

    wget https://downloads.haskell.org/~cabal/cabal-install-3.2.0.0/cabal-install-3.2.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux.tar.xz
    tar -xf cabal-install-3.2.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux.tar.xz
    rm cabal-install-3.2.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux.tar.xz cabal.sig
    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
    mv cabal ~/.local/bin/


This will work on a fresh [AWS instance](AWS.md) and assumes that folder `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`.
On other systems, you must either move the executable to a folder that is in your `PATH` or modify your `PATH` by adding the line

    export PATH="~/.local/bin:$PATH"

to your `.bashrc`-file.

## Adding ~/.local/bin and ~/.cabal/bin to the PATH

Navigate to your home folder:

    $ cd
Open your .bashrc file with nano text editor

    $ nano .bashrc
Go to the bottom of the file and add the following lines

    export PATH="~/.cabal/bin:$PATH"
    export PATH="~/.local/bin:$PATH"

`Ctrl O` and `ENTER` to save the changes, `Ctrl X` to exit nano

Now we need to make the computer read the .bashrc file again (it reads the file at startup)

    source .bashrc

Update cabal 

    cabal update

Above instructions install Cabal version `3.2.0.0`. You can check the version by typing

   cabal --version

Finally we download and install GHC:

    wget https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.6.5/ghc-8.6.5-x86_64-deb9-linux.tar.xz
    tar -xf ghc-8.6.5-x86_64-deb9-linux.tar.xz
    rm ghc-8.6.5-x86_64-deb9-linux.tar.xz
    cd ghc-8.6.5
    ./configure
    sudo make install
    cd ..

## Download the source code for cardano-node

To download the source code, we use git:

    git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node.git


This should create a folder ``cardano-node``, then download the latest source code from git into it.

After the download has finished, we can check its content by

    ls cardano-node

Note that the content of your ``cardano-node``-folder can slightly differ from this!

We change our working directory to the downloaded source code folder:

    cd cardano-node

For reproducible builds, we should check out a specific release, a specific "tag".
For the FF-testnet, we will use tag `1.13.0`, which we can check out as follows:

    git fetch --all --tags
    git tag
    git checkout tags/1.13.0


## Build and install the node

Now we build and install the node with ``cabal``,
which will take a couple of minutes the first time you do a build. Later builds will be much faster, because everything that does not change will be cached.

    cabal install cardano-node cardano-cli --overwrite-policy=always

   This will build and install `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` in folder `~/.cabal/bin` by default, so the remark about your `PATH` from above
   applies here as well: Make sure folder `~/.cabal/bin` is in your path or copy the executables to a folder that is.

If you ever want to update the code to a newer version, go to the ``cardano-node`` directory, pull the latest code with ``git`` and rebuild.
This will be much faster than the initial build:

    cd cardano-node
    git fetch --all --tags
    git tag
    git checkout tags/<the-tag-you-want>
    cabal install cardano-node cardano-cli --overwrite-policy=always

__Note:__ You need to delete the `db`-folder (the database-folder) before running an updated version of the node.
